# OH_Senate_2022
## Introduction
This is a project in Microsoft Power BI that analyzes campaign finance Data from the FEC. My motivation is to show from where candidates get financial support.

## Data 
Downloaded from the FEC's data on the [Ohio Senate Race of 2022](https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/OH/2022/) using *raw* data, especially for [Matt Dolan](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=efiling&committee_id=C00790386). Each candidate with $1 million in total receipts is included along with Morgan Harper.

Old data is all donations on or before September 30, 2021. New data is all donations after the old date, ending on December 31, 2021.

## Dashboards
[Count of Donations](https://github.com/Mhauga/OH_Senate_2022/blob/main/Count%20of%20Donations.png), [Donation Amounts](https://github.com/Mhauga/OH_Senate_2022/blob/main/Donation%20Amounts.png), and [Differences](https://github.com/Mhauga/OH_Senate_2022/blob/main/Differences.png) are the three dashboards included in the Power BI file.
