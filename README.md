# OH_Senate_2022
## Introduction
This is a project in Microsoft Power BI that analyzes campaign finance Data from the FEC. My motivation is to show from where candidates get financial support.

## Data 
Downloaded from the FEC's data on the [Ohio Senate Race of 2022](https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/OH/2022/) using *raw* data, especially for [Matt Dolan](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=efiling&committee_id=C00790386). Each candidate with $1 million in total receipts is included along with Morgan Harper.
